# Loan Prediction Model Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

This project showcases a real-time monitoring solution for a loan prediction model using Prometheus and Grafana. It demonstrates the importance of observability by tracking key performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, and recall. The setup ensures that model behavior is monitored seamlessly during training and production, helping detect issues early.
